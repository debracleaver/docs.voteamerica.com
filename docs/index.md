This is the documentation for the VoteAmerica suite of tools.  

We provide a handful of products for other organizations to use:

* [Embeddable tools](toolset/index.md) that help citizens check their registration status, register to vote, request an absentee or mail-in ballot, find out where to vote, and contact their local elections office.
* An Election Data API [election information data](api/index.md) that surfaces approximately 100 fields of data per state

The tools are free to use and embed on your website. If you'd like access to the data that comes in via a dedicated instance of our toolset, you'll need to sign up for a paid account.  You'll also need to sign up for a paid account if you'd like to use the Election Data API.
- Free tools: [free embed codes](toolset/free.md)
- Paid accounts: Contact [sales@voteamerica.com](mailto:sales@voteamerica.com)

VoteAmerica is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  Paid accounts are managed via VoteAmerica LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of VoteAmerica. We do this for accounting purposes: everyone's life is just easier if software licensing is handled via a distinct legal entity.
