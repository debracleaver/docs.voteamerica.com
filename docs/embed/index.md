# Tool Embeds

All VoteAmerica tools can be embedded in other websites with a short snippet of code. This will load our tool asynchronously via Javascript into a div with the class `voteamerica-embed`. This will not block rendering of the parent page, and the iframe will check the URL of the parent page for [tracking URL arguments](/embed/tracking/).

The tools have minimal branding, and the fonts and color scheme should work with any website design.

For users who do not need access to the information collected by the tools, you can use our [free embed code](https://www.voteamerica.com/embeds/). For users who want the information collected in the tools, you can visit [https://www.readysetvote.io/](https://www.readysetvote.io/) for more information.

Existing Ready Set Vote subscribers can access their custom embed code at [https://dashboard.readysetvote.io/](https://dashboard.readysetvote.io/).
